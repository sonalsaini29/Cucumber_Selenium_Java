## Introduction

In this project, we utilize Selenium, Cucumber, and Java to automate testing of web applications. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, Cucumber facilitates Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and Java provides the programming language for writing the tests.

## Features

- Automated testing of web applications
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach with Cucumber
- Easy to maintain and extend tests
- Integration with various web browsers

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
- WebDriver (for browser automation)
